# Robust estimation using heavy-tailed distributions

[![CRAN status](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/heavy)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=heavy)
[![CRAN RStudio mirror downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/heavy)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=heavy)

The HEAVY package contains routines to perform robust estimation considering heavy-tailed distributions. Currently, the package includes linear regression, linear mixed-effect models, Grubbs' model, multivariate location and scatter estimation, multivariate regression, penalized splines, random variate generation and some support functions.

## Features

* Provide basic functionality for modeling using scale mixtures of normal distributions in R, via a package.
* Calculations associated with parameter estimation are performed by calling routines in C and Fortran.
* Estimation in linear regression, linear mixed effects models, Grubbs' model, multivariate regression and penalized splines using the EM algorithm.
* Estimation of location and Scatter using multivariate heavy-tailed distributions.
* Implemented families: normal, Cauchy, Student-t, slash and contaminated normal.
* Estimation of the shape parameters for Student-t and slash distributions.
* Multivariate random number generation for the implemented families and the uniform distribution on the p-dimensional sphere.
* Print and summary methods and some sample databases.

## Providing Feedback

Please report any bugs/suggestions/improvements to [Felipe Osorio](mailto:felipe.osorios@usm.cl), [Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria](http://www.usm.cl). If you find these routines useful or not then please let me know. Also, acknowledgement of the use of the routines is appreciated.
